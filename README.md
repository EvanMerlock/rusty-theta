# Theta

This is a dumb compiler I wrote with help from Crafting Interpreters.
A lot of this compiler is based off of the bytecode section of the book, with the caveat that this is strongly-typed and focused on some of the higher-level techniques in the first half of the book (recursive descent, environments/symbol tables etc) as Theta is not written in C.
